If Leo would have won an Oscar in Titanic or anything after we wouldn't talk about him nearly as much. maybe??

And the best actor who never won an category but tonight gets an Oscar goes to..... Leonardo DiCaprio.
What's crazy is this wasn't even Leo's best role in my opinion. But at least he won best actor finally
I feel like Leo won't win... BYE
I'm so glad Leonardo won a Grammy I'm proud of him he's a very good actor one of the best.....yes I'm that confident lol
I wonder if Leo will finally win
Leo ain't gonna win, illuminati won't let him
Leo winning for The Revenant would be like Scorsese winning for The Departed. Long deserved, but not what he should have won with.
Leo should have it.... but Im certain he wont D: and it huuurts
